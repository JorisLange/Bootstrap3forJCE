Bootstrap3 Layouts for JCE in Joomla

This will enable people to be able to visualise Bootstrap3 layouts for their content and use Bootstrap3 classes within JCE.  It does not turn JCE into a fully responsive editor ... but it sure as hell helps and hey, the code is here for free, so don't complain.

Once you have these files in your templates css folder, you need to setup in JCE.
To do this go to Editor Global Configuration > Formatting and Display > Custom CSS Files ... and then you can enter:
templates/$template/css/BoostrapEditorHelper.css,
templates/$template/css/font-styles.css
... also make sure you have the option to load custom css styles in the editor turned on ;)

Please feel free to add tweaks or suggestions ... this was developed as part of a client project, so there'll be a few custom things there you wish to tweak.

Have fun with it's a handy little utililty :)
